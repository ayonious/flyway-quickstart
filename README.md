Info: Prints current status of the migration. Which versions are pending and which are applied

Migrate: Migrates a database schema to the current version. It scans the classpath for available migrations and applies pending migrations.

Baseline: Baselines an existing database, excluding all migrations, including baselineVersion. Baseline helps to start with Flyway in an existing database. Newer migrations can then be applied normally.
